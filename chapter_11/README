Chapter 11 - Architectural and Integration Tips

Chapter 11 includes 1 project showing different ways of interaction between
knowledge sessions and process instances:

- SingleSessionPatternsTest.java:
This class contains a set of tests showing the 2 different ways of working
with a self-contained Knowledge Sessions. By self-contained I mean sessions 
that don't require a separate session to be executed. All the processes and rules
run in a single instance of it.

a) The first way is to have an individual knowledge session for each process 
instance we want to start. Each time a process is started a new session is created.
When we want to interact with an existing process instance we need to restore the
corresponding session first. The test singleSessionPerProcessInstance() shows
this behavior. Here, a BusinessEntity instance is created to keep the relation
between a process instance, a work item and a knowledge session. Using this
entity we can restore the corresponding knowledge session and interact with it.
This test uses 1 process definition and creates an individual session
for each instance it starts. The process definition contains 3 asynchronous
tasks whose behavior is implemented by MockAsyncExternalServiceWorkItemHandler
class. This class is in charge of persist a BusinessEntity each time it is 
invoked.

b) Another strategy to start process instances is to keep all the instances of
the same definition in the same knowledge session. This strategy is implemented
by singleSessionPerProcessDefinition() test. In this test, 2 process instances
of the same process definition are started in a single session. The process 
definition and work item handler used by this test are the same that we used in 
singleSessionPerProcessInstance(). A BusinessEntity instance is also used
to keep the relation between the session, the process instance and the active
work item. 

c) The task of starting a process instance could also be delegated to a rule.
This way, we can express the situation where a process instance must be started
in a declarative way. That is exactly what singleSessionPerProcessDefinitionWithRules() 
test does. In this case, a session containing a process definition (the same
definition we used in the previous tests) and a rule resource is used to 
start process instances in a declarative way. The behavior of this test is
the same as b): one session for all process instances of the same definition.
The only difference is that the process instances are not started from the java
code but from the rules. Each time a Person object is inserted in the session,
a new process instance is started in that same session.


- MultiSessionsPatternsTest.java:
This class contains some tests showing how different knowledge sessions can
interact in order to achieve a result (in this case, the completion of a process
instance).

a) multiSessionsCollaboration() test shows how a master session can automatically 
complete a work item handler in a slave session when the required information is 
present. In this case, the master session ('interactionSession' in the test) is 
composed by a set of rules in charge of the completion of work item handlers and
the instantiation of new process instances. In the case of this test, the rule
being used is 'Complete Interaction When We Receive Data' which completes a 
work item handler each time a BusinessEntity is inserted in the session.
The test starts a process instance (same definition and work item handler we 
used before) that persists a BusinessEntity when 'External Service Call' task is 
executed. The Business Entities are then loaded by the test and inserted into
the master session. The master session will complete the work item handlers 
specified by the BusinessEntity and continue with the execution of the related
process instance.

b) multiSessionsWithSessionLocator() test uses the concept of a SessionLocator 
to register slaves sessions.
Based on rules, the master session decides which (process definition), 
when (declaratively expressed with rules) and where (in which slave session)
to start a process instance. The behavior of this test is really simple: for
each Person object inserted in the master session a new process instance is
going to be started in each of the slaves sessions containing the 'com.salaboy.process.AsyncInteractions'
process definition. Just like in the previous test, the concept of a BusinessEntity
is used to keep track of the relation between a session, a work item and a process
instance. Every time a BusinessEntity is inserted in the master session, the
corresponding work item handler is going to be completed.
